# Hardest-game-homemade
In the beginning it will be like a tutorial, you should go to the blue thing, you will go to it, you will teleport to a new scene and the game will start from that moment of teleportation:), when you complete 1level, etc. you have to go to the blue things to get teleported to diffrent levels.
If you die, everything starts from level 1.
control is WASD, A to go left, S to go down, W to go forward and D to go right.
And that should be it.
Enjoy!
